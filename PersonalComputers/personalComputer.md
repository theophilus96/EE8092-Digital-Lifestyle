## Computers
* Computers are everywhere, become a part of everyday life
* computer literacy is vital to success
	* Computer literacy = having knowledge and understanding of computers and their uses

**How is a computer defined**
* An extremely fast electronic device operating under the control of instructions stored in its memory.
* It can accept data
	* raw facts, figures, and symbols
* Process data into useful information
	* data is organised, meaningful and useful
* produces and stores results for future use

## Information processing cycle
5 elements of information processing:
* Input 
* Process
* Output
* Storage
* Communication

A computer contains many electric, electronic and mechanical components known as hardware.

Input device
* allows you to enter data and instructions into a computer
* hardware used to enter data and instructions
* example:
	* scanner
	* camera
	* keyboard
	* mouse
	* microphone
	* webcam
Output device
* Hardware component that conveys information to one or more people
* Example:
	* Printer
	* Speaker
	* Monitor
* examples of both input and output devices:
	* Modem
	* Sound card
System Unit
* case that contains the electronic component of the computer that are used to process data
* Example:
	* Desktop
Storage device:
* holds data, instructions, and information for future use
Communications Device
* Enables a computer to send and receive data, instructions, and information to and from one or more computers or mobile devices

## Advantage and disadvantages of using computers

### Advantages
* Speed
	* When data, instructions and information flow along the electronic circuits inside a computer, they travel at high speeds
	* Many computers process billions of operations in a single second
	* Speed of light = 1 foot per nanosecond(ns)  
	* 1 ns = 1 clock tick of a 1GHz processor
* Reliability
	* The electronic components found in most modern computers are dependable and reliable
* Consistency
	* If you give the computer the same input and the same processes to complete, a computer will always produce the same results
	* An expression has grown in the computer field that describes consistency
		* Garbage in, garbage out
* Storage
	* A computer can transfer data quickly from storage to memeory, process it, and then store it again for future use.
	* Many computers store enormous amounts of data and make this data available for processing anytime it is needed
	* The library of congress is commonly estimated at 10 terabutes for all printed material
* Communications
	* Most computers today can communicate with other computers
	* computers can share any of the four information processing cycle operations with other computers or another user
		* Input
		* process
		* output
		* storage

### Disadvantages
* Health risk
	* prolonged or improper computer use can lead to injuries or disorders of the hands, wrist, elbows, eyes, neck and back
	* Two health risk are computer addiction and technology overload:
		* Computer addiction = when someone becomes obsessed with using a computer
		* Technology overload = when individuals feel distressed when deprived of computers and mobile devices

* violation of privacy
	* Nearly every life event is stored in a computer:
		* examples:
			* Medical records
			* credit reports
			* tax records
	* People have found that their privacy violated and identities stolen when the information was stored in unsecure ways

* public safety
	* People use computers to share their photos, video, music and other personal information publicly
	* The computer users ahev become victims to cromes committed by strangers
	* Do not share information that would allow others to identify or locate you
	* Do not publicly display identification numbers, passwords, or other private details

* impact on labour force
	* Computers have increased productivity throughout the world
	* An entire industry has been formed by computers and many jobs have been created to support it
	* However, people are now being replaced by a computer in the workplace
* Impact on environment
	* As with any industrial process, natureal resources are used and waste is generated.
	* When computers are discarded in landfills, they release toxic materials such as lead and mercury

### Green computing
Green computing involves reducing the electricity consumed and environmental waste generated when using a computer

Strategies:
* Recycling
* regulating manufacturing processes
* extending the life of computers
* immediately donating or properly disposing of replaced computers
