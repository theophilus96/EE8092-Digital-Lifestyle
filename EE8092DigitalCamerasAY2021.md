# Digital Cameras

### Exposure setting
* Aperture-priority auto-exposure ( mode A)
	* photographer specifies the aperture (f -stop), and the camera selects the shutter speed needed to produce a good exposure.
	* Affect the depth of field
* Shutter priority auto-exposure (mode S)
	* photographer specifies the shutter speed, and teh camera selects the aperture setting needed to exposr the picture properly
	* help to 'freeze' moving objects
* Programmed auto exposure (mode P)
	* the camera automatically adjusts aperture and the shutter speed for optimal exposure
* Manual exposure ( Mode M)
	* The photographer chooses both aperture and shutter speed, providing the greatest latitude for creative expression

### Exposure compensation
* exposure compensation is a way to rectify improper exposure. It  is also known as exposure value (EV) adjustment
* common range of EV value: -2 to 2
* to produce a brighter image, increase the EV value 
* to produce a darker image, decreasse the EV value

### Automatic Bracketing
* capture a series of shots, each at different exposure, with one press of the shutter button
* Ensure at least one image with correct exposure

### Lens
* Stucture and concepts
	* Depth of FIeld (DoF)
	* Focal Length
	* Optifcal Zoom vs Digital Zoom

#### Depth of Field
* Focus
	* The point where light rays originating from a point on the onject converge. Although the focus is conceptually a point, physically the focus has a spatial extent.
* Depth of Field
	* The distance in front of and beyond the subject that appears to be in focus.

* Depth of field is controlled by the lens F-stop. Increasing the F stop numbe increases the DOF

#### Aperture, shutter speed and ISO

#### Optical and Digital Zoom
Optical zoom
* Works like a zoom lens on a film camera. It change focal length and magnification as it is zoomed. Image quality stays high throughout the zoom range.

Digital zoom
* is a software feature, it simply crops the image to a smaller size, then enlarges the copped portion to fill the frame again. Digital zoom results in loss of quality.

#### Focal Length

Focal length
* The distance from the center of the lens to the focal plane. Magnification (object size) and viewing angle depend on focal length:
	* Wide-angle (short focal length)
	* Telephoto (long focal length)
	* Normal (for typical photo shotting ~ 35mm)
* The longer the focal length, the smaller the veiw angle, the larger the object size on image
* The focal length of an optical syustem is a measure of how strongly it converges (focuses) light.

l#### Flash memory
 * Flash memory is a type of electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) chip
 * Advantages of flash memory over hard disk
	 * quiet
	 * lighter and smaller in size
	 * no moving parts
	 * flexibility in data transfer
	
* disadvantages over hard disk
	* cost per GB higher
	* capacity is smaller
	
### Image format
Popular Image Formats:
* JPEG, TIFF and RAW
* Pros and cons
* EXIF

#### JPEG ( joint photographic experts group)
JPEG is a commonly used method of compression for digital image. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality.
![](https://tik4.com/wp-content/uploads/Difference-Between-Lossy-and-Lossless.jpg)

Pros:
* small file size
* excellent compatibility with web, computer etc

Cons:
* baseline JPEG is a lossy format, which means that it loses some image information
* The higher the compression ratio, thje more information it loses

#### Tagged image file format
TIFF is a standard in the printing and publishing industry. TIFF files are significantly larger than their JPEG counterparts, and can be either uncompressed or compressed using lossless compression.
![](![RAW, JPEG and TIFF. What they are and when to use them.](http://www.bobatkins.com/photography/digital/raw-flowchart2.gif)

Pros:
* High image quality
* Widely supported by image editing software in publication

Cons:
* Large file size
* In-camera image processing is significantly slower, so you will be limited in the number of fast pictures you can take.

#### RAW

The RAW file contains untouched, raw pixel information straight from the digital camera's sensor
![](http://www.bobatkins.com/photography/digital/raw-flowchart1.gif)


Pros:
* All original detail stays in the image which allows manipulation of image data to achieve the higher quality image

Cons:
* Large file sizes (although not as large as TIFF)
* Cannot be used immediately since they require specific software to convert them into compatible image format (TIFF or JPEG)

#### EXIF
Exchangeable image file format (EXIF) is a standard that specifies the formats for images in metadata
![](https://www.fireebok.com/images/resource/osx/editeifdataphoto.png)

### Connectivity
Structure and concepts
* USB 
* HDMI

#### USB

* USB 2
	* transfer speeds of up to 480 Mbps. Backwards compartible with usb 1.1 ports on a pc
* USB 3
	* transfer speed of up to 5 Gbps. backward compatible with USB 2

#### HDMI
connectivity of digitak cameras ato display devices
* HDMI type a = full size
* HDMI type c = mini
* HDMI type d = micro

#### Battery
Should provide a constant levl of power until it runs out
* rechargeable batteries (lithium-ion) are designed for this purpose
* Disposable alkaline batteries provide fairly constant power then slowly weaken to the point not enought to operate the camera.

## Digital Camera: Features and functionalities
Features:
* optical image stabilizer
* face recognition
* red-eye effect reduction
* etc

### Optical image stabilizer (OIS)
pictures are vulnerable to hand shake:
* slow shutter speeds (due to poor lighting condition) can result in a blurry image
* Tele and macro-photo will increase the effect of hand shake
* use gyrosensors to detect jitters aand adjust optical axis to cancel hand-shake effect.

### Face detection
* Face detection technology uses pattern recognition algorithms to detect typical face patterns in an image
* The camera then automatically adjust both the foucs and exposure to provide the best portrait possible.

### Red Eye effects
* When: a flash is used in a dark environment
* Why: light of the flash is reflecting from the retina, which is covered with tiny blood vessels
* The more open the pupils are, the more red eye effect you get. Red eye is more pronounced in people with light eye color.

#### Red eye effect reduction
* if possible, avoid taking flash photos in a dark environment
* use red eye reduction pre flash
	* red eye reduction works by having the flash shine a light into the eyes of the subject prior to taking the picture. This causes the pupil to contract.
* Image editing software
	* use editing software to correct red eye effect

## Photography tips
* rule of thirds
* diagonal rule
* Miscellaneous tips

### rule of thirds
The rule states that an image should be divided into nine equal parts by 2 vertical and 2 horizontal lines, and important compositional elements should be placed along these lines or their intersections
![enter image description here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/RuleOfThirds-SideBySide.gif/650px-RuleOfThirds-SideBySide.gif)

place your photo so that the main subjects are located around one of the intersection points rather than in the center of the image
### Diagonal rule
The diagonal rule states that a photograph looks more dynamic if the object falls or follow a diagonal line

## Joint  Photographic Expert Group
why is image compression possible ?
* image can be compressed because it contains the following redundancies
	* spacial redundancies
	* psychovisual redundancy

### Spatial redundancy
(intraframe redundancy)
represents the statistical correlation between pixels within a small image neighborhood.

Elements that are duplicated within a structure, such as pixels in a still image and bit patterns in a file. Exploiting a spatial redundancy is how compression is performed.

### Psychovisual redundancy
* texture masking
* frequency masking
* color masking

It is known that the human eye does not respond to all visual information with equal sensitivity. Some information is simply of less relative importance. The information is referred to as psychovisual redundant and can be eliminated without any significant difference to the human eye. The reduction of redundant visual information has some practical applications in image compression. Since the reduction of psychovisual redundancy results in quantitative loss of information, this type of reductions is referred to as quantisation. The most common technique for quantisation is the reduction of number of colors used in the image, thus color quantisation. Since some information is lost, the color quantisation is an irreversible process. So the compression techniques that used such process are lossy. It should be noted that even if this method of compression is acceptable the compression can be very effective and reduce the size of the image considerably.

### Lossy and loseless compression
Lossless compression:
* use in important data (e.g medical image)
* reconstructed image is identical to the original image after decompression

Lossy compression:
* For media such as image or video, it is not necessary to display more information than the human ear or eye can perceive. Thus the compression techniques may discard data with little perceived difference by humans
* Reconstructed image is not identical to the original image after decompression

### JPEG overview
* very popular image compression scheme.
* JPEG is know as ISO/IEC international standard 10918 or the ITU-T recommendation T.81
* developed by an international body know as athe Joint Photographic Expert Group (JPEG)
* four distinct modes of operation:
	* sequential DCT-based mode (baseline JPEG)
	* progressive DCT-based mode
	* lossless mode
	* hierarchical mode

* main idea of baseline JPEG:
	* image contents change slowly across images
	* this means that lower spatial frequency componentns are more dominant than higher frequency components
	* humans are more sensitive to lower frequency components
	* JPEG uses the frequency domain analysis (DCT), emphasize on low frequency information, and then performs compression using entropy coding.

#### Baseline JPEG
* we will focus on sequential DCT-based coding mode,which is known as baseline JPEG
* 5 main stages associated with baseline JPEG:
	* image block processing
	* forward 2D- DCT
	* Quantisation
	* Entropy encoding
	* Frame building

![enter image description here](https://www.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/media-1101219-fig1.jpg)

#### Image block processing
* Image preparation
	* ![enter image description here](https://images.slideplayer.com/35/10351218/slides/slide_20.jpg)
* Image partitioning
	* Image is first partitioned into blocks of 8x8 pixels
		* ![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HzTAf.jpg)

#### Forward DCT
The two dimensional Discrete cosine transform (2D-DCT) is applied to each 8x8 block

#### JPEG DCT basis function
![enter image description here](https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/cs184_sp16_content/lectures/19_image-processing/images/slide_014.jpg)

#### 2D-DCT in JPEG
![enter image description here](https://www.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/media-1101221-fig2.jpg)

example of 2D-DCT 
![enter image description here](http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/cerl/files/2015/09/jpeg_compress4.gif)

#### 2D-DCT coding
why 2D-DCT transform?
* to convert the data into a form which is more suitable for compression
* Transformation reduces the correlation between the coefficients (redundancy reduction)
* Transformation yields energy compaction

#### DCT coefficients
![enter image description here](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780750689755000054-gr20.jpg)

#### Quantisation
* human responds primarily to DC coefficient and lower AC coefficients
* Hence, high frequency information is de-emphasized/discarded through quantisation
* Information loss occurs during quantisation
* The values in the quantisation table are a compromise between the level of compression and the resulting information loss
* Quantisation of the transformed DCT coeffficients is performed:

#### Entropy Encoding
Entropy encoding contains
* zig-zag scanning
* Huffman encoding

Zig-zag scanning
* exploit the presence of large number of zeros in the quantised matrix
* ![enter image description here](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRO84NpodURCZ8cPNXf16vjEP-M35DTHweEMA&usqp=CAU)

Huffman coding
* high compression is achieved by replacing frequent patterns with shorter codewords
* ![enter image description here](https://www.print-driver.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/color-column-01.png)

#### Frame building

The JPEG standard includes a definition on the stucture of the bitstream relating to the image. This is known as a frame

The role of the frame builder is to encapsulate all the information relating to an encoded image in this format.
