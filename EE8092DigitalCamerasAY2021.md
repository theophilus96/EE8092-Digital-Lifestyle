# Digital Cameras

### Exposure setting
* Aperture-priority auto-exposure ( mode A)
	* photographer specifies the aperture (f -stop), and the camera selects the shutter speed needed to produce a good exposure.
	* Affect the depth of field
* Shutter priority auto-exposure (mode S)
	* photographer specifies the shutter speed, and teh camera selects the aperture setting needed to exposr the picture properly
	* help to 'freeze' moving objects
* Programmed auto exposure (mode P)
	* the camera automatically adjusts aperture and the shutter speed for optimal exposure
* Manual exposure ( Mode M)
	* The photographer chooses both aperture and shutter speed, providing the greatest latitude for creative expression

### Exposure compensation
* exposure compensation is a way to rectify improper exposure. It  is also known as exposure value (EV) adjustment
* common range of EV value: -2 to 2
* to produce a brighter image, increase the EV value 
* to produce a darker image, decreasse the EV value

### Automatic Bracketing
* capture a series of shots, each at different exposure, with one press of the shutter button
* Ensure at least one image with correct exposure

### Scene mode
* Special shooting modes that automatically select an aperture and shutter speed that is suitable for specific shooting condition

### Lens
* Stucture and concepts
	* Depth of FIeld (DoF)
	* Focal Length
	* Optifcal Zoom vs Digital Zoom

#### Depth of Field
* Focus
	* The point where light rays originating from a point on the onject converge. Although the focus is conceptually a point, physically the focus has a spatial extent.
* Depth of Field
	* The distance in front of and beyond the subject that appears to be in focus.

#### Depth of field and F stop

* Depth of field is controlled by the lens F-stop. Increasing the F stop numbe increases the DOF

#### Aperture, shutter speed and ISO

#### Optical and Digital Zoom
Optical zoom
* Works like a zoom lens on a film camera. It change focal length and magnification as it is zoomed. Image quality stays high throughout the zoom range.

Digital zoom
* is a software feature, it simply crops the image to a smaller size, then enlarges the copped portion to fill the frame again. Digital zoom results in loss of quality.

#### Focal Length

Focal length
* The distance from the center of the lens to the focal plane. Magnification (object size) and viewing angle depend on focal length:
	* Wide-angle (short focal length)
	* Telephoto (long focal length)
	* Normal (for typical photo shotting ~ 35mm)
* The longer the focal length, the smaller the veiw angle, the larger the object size on image
* The focal length of an optical syustem is a measure of how strongly it converges (focuses) light.

### Storage
Structure and concepts
* memory cards
* image formats
* JPEG, TIFF, RAW

#### Memory Cards
* based on flash memory
* sample storage capacity 32,64,128 GB
* different memory cards used in digital cameras:
	* secure digital (SD)
	* SD high capacity (SDHC)
	* SD extended capacity (SDXC)

l#### Flash memory
 * Flash memory is a type of electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) chip
 * Advantages of flash memory over hard disk
	 * quiet
	 * lighter and smaller in size
	 * no moving parts
	 * flexibility in data transfer
	
* disadvantages over hard disk
	* cost per GB higher
	* capacity is smaller
	
### Image format
Popular Image Formats:
* JPEG, TIFF and RAW
* Pros and cons
* EXIF

#### JPEG ( joint photographic experts group)
JPEG is a commonly used method of compression for digital image. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality.
![](https://tik4.com/wp-content/uploads/Difference-Between-Lossy-and-Lossless.jpg)

Pros:
* small file size
* excellent compatibility with web, computer etc

Cons:
* baseline JPEG is a lossy format, which means that it loses some image information
* The higher the compression ratio, thje more information it loses

#### Tagged image file format
TIFF is a standard in the printing and publishing industry. TIFF files are significantly larger than their JPEG counterparts, and can be either uncompressed or compressed using lossless compression.
![](![RAW, JPEG and TIFF. What they are and when to use them.](http://www.bobatkins.com/photography/digital/raw-flowchart2.gif)

Pros:
* High image quality
* Widely supported by image editing software in publication

Cons:
* Large file size
* In-camera image processing is significantly slower, so you will be limited in the number of fast pictures you can take.

#### RAW

The RAW file contains untouched, raw pixel information straight from the digital camera's sensor
![](http://www.bobatkins.com/photography/digital/raw-flowchart1.gif)


Pros:
* All original detail stays in the image which allows manipulation of image data to achieve the higher quality image

Cons:
* Large file sizes (although not as large as TIFF)
* Cannot be used immediately since they require specific software to convert them into compatible image format (TIFF or JPEG)

#### EXIF
Exchangeable image file format (EXIF) is a standard that specifies the formats for images in metadata

### Connectivity
Structure and concepts
* USB 
* HDMI

#### USB
Connectivity of digital cameras to PC
* USB 1:

* USB 2
	* transfer speeds of up to 480 Mbps. Backwards compartible with usb 1.1 ports on a pc
* USB 3
	* transfer speed of up to 5 Gbps. backward compatible with USB 2
