### TV and display
* Structure and concept
* TV types:
	* Direct view (CRT)
	* Projection
	* Flat panel
	* Smart
	* 3D
	* ETC

Basic concepts:
1. screen size
2. resolution
3. scan type and rate
4. aspect ratio
5. contrast ratio
6. viewing angle 
7. power consumption
8. SDTV, HDTV, UHDTV

#### Screen size
* measured diagonally across the viewing area
* example:
	* A 32" TV
		* 16:9 (widescreen)
		* 4:3 (non widescreen)
* Is bigger screen size better ?
	* Depends on the size of the room
	* Expected seating distance from the display
![](https://thetechrevolutionist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tv-screen.jpg)

#### Display resolution
* The number of pixels of a TV image
* Commonly expressed in terms onf width x height
	* Example:
		* 1280 x 720 means the width is 1280 pixels and the height is 720 pixels
* Display resolution:
	* Display's native resolution
* Input resolution:
	* Depends on the video sources

#### Scan types
* Interlaced: 2 fields (odd and even lines) are scanned separately 
* Progressive: all the lines are scanned in sequence

#### Scan rate
Scan rate
* how often a picture is redrawn on the screen per second
* Measured in terms of:
	* Number of fields for interlaced scan
	* Number of frames for progressive scan
* standards:
	* PAL: 25 fp (50 field/s),
		* Used in australia and singapore
	* NTSC: 30 fps (60 field/s)
		* Used in USA and Japan

#### Aspect ratio
* Describe the ratio of width to height in TV screen
* Popular aspect ratio:
	* 4:3
	* 16:9
	* 21:9
![](https://i.rtings.com/images/black-bars-aspect-ratio-16-9-21-9-4-3-cinemawide.png)


#### Contrast ratio
* An indicatror of overall picture quality
``` 
contrast ratio(CR) = Brightness at the screen when all pixels are white
				 	____________________________________________________ 
				 	 Brightness at the screeen when all pixels are black 
  ``` 

* higher contrast ratio gives better performance quality
* human visual evaluation is the most reliable measure
![](https://www.projectisle.com.au/Images/Buyers-Guide/contrast.jpg)

#### Viewing angle
* maximum angle at which a display can be viewed with acceptable visual performace
* E.g. 160 degrees or 80 degrees from the center
![](http://blog.bestbuy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/31636i97975661FF1B2827.jpg)

#### Power consumption
* Determined by three main factors
	* screen size
	* technology type used
		* Example
			* Plasma  
			* LCD
	* picture brightness
* TV power consumption
	* energy star

Pros:
* Reasonable color fidelity, contrast and viewing angle
Cons:
* Bulky and heavy
* smaller screen
* obsolete

#### Projection TV
* A projection TV creates a small picture and uses a beam of light to display that picture at a much larger size
* Type:
	* Rear projection TV
		* A reflective rear projection system projects the picture on the back of a screen that is built into the TV itself
	* Front projection TV
		* A transmissive front-projection system uses a projector and a separate screen and it projects images onto the front of that screen. This setup is similar to movie theater
		* ![](https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/encyclopedia-terms/front-projection-tv-frontprj.fit_lim.size_1050x.gif)
* Both configuration use tiny devices capable of making very detailed pictures, thye can be:
	* Reflective - light picks up the picture by bouncing off the device
	* Transmissive - light picks up the picture by travelling through the device
* A lens magnifies the picture and projects it onto the screen

**Pros:**
* Large screen size
**Cons:**
* front projection: require setup
* rear projection: 
	* smaller viewing angle, 
	* glare, 
	* thicker than flat-panel TV, 
	* getting obsolete

#### Flat panel TV
Types:
1. Plasma
2. LCD
3. LED
4. OLED

#### Plasma TV
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B5HMMDRBpKc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Principle and structure**
The basic idea is each subpixel is a microscopic fluorescent lamp that emits one primary color - red, green or blue. By varying the intensity of the light from these 3 subpixels, a multitude of tints can be displayed. Certain gases (e.g. neon and xenon gas) become plasma and emit colored light when subject to electric voltage.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Plasma-display-composition.svg/440px-Plasma-display-composition.svg.png)

**Plasma formation**
* When voltage is applied, electrons are torn off form the gas to form plasma
* When voltage is stopped, electrons will combine with plasma to form gas again. The extra energy released are in the form of **Ultraviolet photons**
* Ultraviolet radiation excites the phosphor coating inside the cell to give off visible light

#### Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TV
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0B79dGR19Tg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Principle and strucure**
Liquid crystal display (LCD) TV operates when light from behind the screen is shone through a succession of polarizing filters, electrodes and matrix of tiny liquid crystal cells. Different voltages at each subpixel control the amount of color to pass through

![](https://assets.pid.samsungdisplay.com/s3fs-public/LCD_Function.gif)

**How it works**
1. Two pieces of polarised glass with polarizing film at 90 degree
2. light is polarized by the first filter
3. as the light passes through the liquid crystal layer, the crystal's molecules bend the light, or change the light's polarisation plane. The alignment of liquid crystal can be adjusted by the electrode voltage
4. The color filter layer consist of numerous subpixels (Red green blue). Each subpixel can be controlled independently by electrode voltage to yield different colors for each pixel
5. The polarised light will then pass through the second polarised filter


#### Light emitting diode (LED) TV

* Can be considered to be a better modification of LCD TV
* Difference:
	* LED TV use LED array to light up the LCD display 
	* LCD TV uses a fluorescent backlight to light up the LCD screen
![](https://www.flatpanelshd.com/pictures/OLED_LCD_lcd_panel.jpg)

#### Organic light emitting diode (OLED) TV
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZcTxI4QoGAo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

OLED is a LED in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound which emit light in response to an electric current

### 3D TV
* 3D principle
* active shutter 3D vs passive 3D
* glassless 3D
* 3D content
* Pros and Cons

**3D principle**
When you focus on an object, your brain takes into account the effort it required to adjust your eyes to focus on it as well as how much your eyes had to converge. Together, this information allows you to estimate how far away the object is.

The secret to 3D television and movies is that by showing each eye the same simage in two different perspective, you can trick your brain into thinkiing the flat image you're viewing has depth.

**Different 3D Techniques**
1. 3D ready tv
2. With Glasses
	* Passive glasses
		* anaglyph glasses using 2 different color filters
		* polarised glases
	* Active shutter glasses
3. Without glasses
	* auto stereoscopy technology
		* parallax barrier
		* lenticular lens

#### Passive Anaglyph glasses
Anaglyph glasses uses two different color filters (e.g. red and blue) to filter the images you look at on the televison screen. Because each eye can only see one set of images, your brain interprets this to mean that both eyes are looking at the same object. That is what creates the perception of depth.

![enter image description here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Hammer_anaglyph_%2814656149338%29.jpg)
#### Passive Polarised glasses

* A more popular technique is polarised filters. Each lens only allows compatible polarised light through, hence each eye will see only one set of images on the screen.
* Polarised lenses do not distort the color and provide a better experience
* Recent displays use horizontal polarizing stripes overlaying the screen. The stripes alternate polarization with each line. This permits use of inexpensive passive glasses. The disadvantage is that each polarisation can display only half as many scanning lines

#### Active shutter 3D glasses
* Active shutter glasses are small LCD screens that alternately dim the left and right lenses in quick succession
* They rely on an infrared signal emitter in the TV that tells the glasses when they should dim each lens, so each eye can see the iamge intended for it.
*  The brain can create the sensation of depth from the visual disparity

![enter image description here](https://demo.idg.com.au/idgns/images/c28f926918-samsung_3D_glasses.jpg)

#### Passive polarised vs active shutter glasses
**Advantages**
* Polarised glasses are inexpensive
* Polarised glasses don'r require power or recharge
* Polarised glasses don't require a transmitter to synchronise with the display
* There is no flicker or ghosting with polarised glasses

**Disadvantages**
* Polarised systems have half the resolution of shutter systems ( the combined effect of both eyes is still considered 1080p)

#### 3D TV without glasses

Auto-stereoscopy is a method of displaying stereoscopic images without the use of special glasses.
Also known as glasses free 3D or glassless 3D

The main techniques are:
* parallax barrier
* lenticular display

**Autostereoscopy** is any method of displaying [stereoscopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy "Stereoscopy") images (adding [binocular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_vision "Binocular vision") perception of 3D depth) without the use of special headgear or glasses on the part of the viewer. Because headgear is not required, it is also called "**glasses-free 3D**" or "**glassesless 3D**". There are two broad approaches currently used to accommodate motion parallax and wider viewing angles: eye-tracking, and multiple views so that the display does not need to sense where the viewers' eyes are located.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereoscopy#cite_note-1) Examples of autostereoscopic displays technology include [lenticular lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_lens "Lenticular lens"), [parallax barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_barrier "Parallax barrier"), [volumetric display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_display "Volumetric display"), [holographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography "Holography") and [light field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_imaging "Integral imaging") displays.


**Parallax barrier**
![enter image description here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Parallax_barrier_vs_lenticular_screen.svg/220px-Parallax_barrier_vs_lenticular_screen.svg.png)
A **parallax barrier** is a device placed in front of an image source, such as a [liquid crystal display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_crystal_display "Liquid crystal display"), to allow it to show a [stereoscopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_display "3D display") or [multiscopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiscopy "Multiscopy") image without the need for the viewer to wear [3D glasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy#3D_glasses "Stereoscopy"). Placed in front of the normal LCD, it consists of an opaque layer with a series of precisely spaced slits, allowing each eye to see a different set of [pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel "Pixel"), so creating a sense of depth through [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax "Parallax") in an effect similar to what [lenticular printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_printing "Lenticular printing") produces for printed products[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_barrier#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_barrier#cite_note-2) and [lenticular lenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_lens "Lenticular lens") for other displays. A disadvantage of the method in its simplest form is that the viewer must be positioned in a well-defined spot to experience the 3D effect. However, recent versions of this technology have addressed this issue by using face-tracking to adjust the relative positions of the pixels and barrier slits according to the location of the user's eyes, allowing the user to experience the 3D from a wide range of positions.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_barrier#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_barrier#cite_note-4) Another disadvantage is that the horizontal pixel count viewable by each eye is halved, reducing the overall horizontal resolution of the image.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_barrier#cite_note-5)

 **Lenticular lens**
![enter image description here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Sq3d-Feuille_lenticulaire.jpg/220px-Sq3d-Feuille_lenticulaire.jpg)
A **lenticular lens** is an array of magnifying lenses, designed so that when viewed from slightly different angles, different images are magnified.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_lens#cite_note-1)[_[failed verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")  –  [see discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lenticular_lens#Strong_definition_needed_for_%22Lenticular_lens%22 "Talk:Lenticular lens")_] The most common example is the lenses used in [lenticular printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_printing "Lenticular printing"), where the technology is used to give an illusion of depth, or to make images that appear to change or move as the image is viewed from different angles.

A **preamp** can't be used as an **amp** because they **do** different jobs. A **preamp** boosts weak signals to line level, whereas an **amp** boosts the line level so it can be heard through speakers. Although their jobs are similar, **you** couldn't replace an **amp** with a **preamp**, or vice versa.

#### Power Amplifier
* Amplify low-power audio signals (20Hz -20Hz) to a level suitable for driving loudspeakers
* Key parameters:
	* Frequency response
	* gain
	* noise
	* distortion
* Power Gain
	* Input signal: a few hundred microwatts
	* Output signal: tens, hundreds, or thousands of watts

#### Surround sound processor
* Decode the incoming audio signal into multiple surround sound channels
* example: Dolby digital 7.1 channel
	* left front
	* right front
	* left surround
	* right surround
	* left rear
	* right rear
	* center
	
#### Integrated AV receiver

### Speakers
* Woofers and tweeters
	* convert electrical signals into sound
	* electrical signal (alternating current) causes the voice coil to move back and forth
	* moving cone serves as a diaphragm/air pump to vibrate the air in front of the speaker
	* Managing multiple drivers:
		* low frequency signal below 2kHz is fed to woofer
		* High frequency signal above 2kHz is fed to tweeter
* Subwoofers
	* Reproduces the very low bass frequencies in music and movie sound-tracks
	* 2 types:
		* Front/side firing subwoofer
		* Down-firing subwoofer

### Dolby Surround Sound
* Dolby digital
* Dolby Digital EX
* Dolby Pro Logic 
* Dolby Atmos

**Dolby**
* Audio compression technology developed by dolby laboratory
* Lossy vs lossless compression

#### Dolby Digital
A worldwide industry standard surround sound audio codec designed to deliver 5.1 channels of audio.

* 5 discrete channels of sound
	* left front right front
	* left surround right surround
	* center front
* ".1" a separate low frequency effects (LFE) channel
* Audio format for:
	* DVDs
	* blu ray
	* cable
	* broadcast
	* satellite TV


In **audio**/**sound** terms **discrete** refers to multichannel **audio** or soundtrack being stored with each individual channel isolated from the other tracks. Contrast with matrixed where multichannels are blended.

#### Dolby Digital EX
Dolby digital EX extends the dolby digital 5.1 channel setup with additional back surround channel ( reproduced through one or 2 speakers) for extra detail adn surround sound effect.

Dolby 6.1 vs 7.1
* 6.1 has a single back center channel surround, while 7.1 has two extra channels (rear left and rear right)

	 ![enter image description here](http://www.ixbt.com/multimedia/creative/inspire-6700/6.1.gif)

#### Dolby Pro Logic
* Dolby pro logic includes 4 channels of surround sound
* The audio channel has 4 data streams:
	* left
	* right
	* center
	* rear
* No low frequency effects (LFE) channel
* Matrix vs. Discrete
	* Dolby Pro Logic: matrix
	* Dolby Digital & Dolby Digital EX: discrete

#### Dolby Atmos
* A new surround sound format (competitor to DTS:X)
* used in cinemas and home theaters
* new height channels create more immersive sound (vs Dolby digital)
* height speakers can be replaced by upward firing speakers
* atmos treats sound as "objects" rather than channels. It assigns sound to a place instead of a channel/speaker
* atmos can scale with number of speakers
* naming conventions:
	* 5.1.2
		* 5.1 dolby digital + 2 height speakers

## Media player and storage
* Optical storage
* CD, VCD, DVD, blu ray disc (BD)
* Media player and server
### Optical storage
optical data storage
* catalyst for the devcelopment of multimedia technology
Optical storage
* CD-DA, CDROM, VCD, DVD, blu ray
Property:
* Good storage density at lower cost
* convenient

**History of optical storage**
* 1982 : compact disc digital audio
* 1985 compact disc read only memory (CDROM)
* 1991 Compact disc recordable (CD R)
* 1995 Compact disc read write (CD RW)
* 1996 Digital verstatile Disc (DVD)
* 2006 HD DVD and Blur ray


### Principle
A CD has a single spiral track of data

Optical disc consist of a sequence of pits and lands within a track. The pits and lands represents data on the surface.

Information is interpreted using the intensity of laser light reflected during reading

All Optical media (CD, DVD, Blu-Ray etc.) have pits and lands. These are microscopic and represent the binary  [information](https://ecomputernotes.com/fundamental/information-technology/what-do-you-mean-by-data-and-information)  of the data stored on the disc. A land is reflective and reflects the laser into a sensor to register it as a I, but when the light hits a pit, it shatters and no reflection is received, thus a O is registered.

To write 1’ & 0’s on CD, a laser beam is used. To write 1, the laser beam is turned on, which turns a pit up to the reflecting layer. To write 0, the laser beam is not turned on & hence, no pit is burned. The surface when there is no pit is called land.

### DVD
In 1995, several companies joined to form the DVD consortium and passed the first standards in the frame work of DVD forum in April 1996

DVD-video is a consumer video format used to store digital video on DVD discs

* codec = MPEG-2
* Resolution:
	* NTSC: 720 x480 ~ 352x 240
	* PAL:  720 x 576 ~ 352 x 288
* Frame rate:
	* NTSC: 30fps
	* PAL : 25fps
* bitrate:
	* 9.8 Mbps
	* constant bitrate

**DVD vs CD**

DVD achieves higher capacity than CD by using smaller pits which yields higher track density, combined with a larger data area, more efficient coding of bits, more efficient error correction amd lower sector overhead.
