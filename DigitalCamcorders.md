Spatial resolution: number of pixels in each frame
Aspect ratio: ratio of image width to image height
Color resolution: bit depth of frames
Video data rate & file size

``` 
Example
24-bit color video, with 640 by 480 resolution at 30fps
uncompressed video rate = 640 x 480 x 24 x 30
						= 221, 184, 000
```
