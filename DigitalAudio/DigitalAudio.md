## Digital audio

Short history:
1. 1896 Gramophone record

3. 1963 Compact cassete
4. 1982 compact disk
5. 1995 MP3

### What is an audio signal

* Audio signalas are signals or sounds that are audible to humans.
* Frequencies in the range of 20 to 20,000 Hz

### Sound propogation
https://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/Demos/waves/wavemotion.html
 
 Sound is a sequence of waves of pressure which propagates through compressible media such as air or water. (Sound can propagate through solids as well, but there are additional modes of propagation). During their propagation, waves can be reflected, refracted, or attentuated by the medium.

**Sound is produced** due to vibration of different objects. **Sound** travels as a longitudinal wave through a material medium. **Sound** travels as successive compressions and rarefactions in the medium. In **sound propagation**, it is the energy of the **sound** that travels and not the particles of the medium.

### Terms and concepts
Wavelength λ (in meter)
* Distance occupied by one cycle of an acoustic wave

Frequency f (in Hertz)
* number of cycles per second

Period T ( in second)
* amount of time to complete one cycle

Speed v (in meter/second)
* Rate at which sound propogates through the medium
* v =fλ or v = λ/T ( speed of sound is 344 m/s in air)

### Loudness, pitch and timbre
 Loudness
 * sound intensity (or pressure) at a location, particularly measured close to the eardrums.
 * Loudness is measured in decibels
 * **Loudness** is proportional to the square of the amplitude

Pitch
* Perceptual correlation of waveform frequency 
* Faster waveform gives rise to higher pitch
* Pitch variations over time provide the basis of melody for most music

Timbre
* Quality of sound ( e.g. bright, dull, harsh, and hollow)
* Describe anything that distinguishes two sounds, (e.g. a violin and a piano playing the same note sound very different, based on their sound quality ao timbre)
* Sounds with more high frequency energy tend to sound brighter or harsher, while those with more low-frequency content tends to sound deep or rich.
 
## Analog Audio
* Natural audio signals are analog
* Disadvantages:
	* Data fidelity in reproduction
	* durability

### Advantages of Digital audio over analog
* Wider dynamic range
* Increased resistance to noise 
* Easy and exact reproduction
* Durability
* Easy to edit, transfer, distribute and store
* Provide error correction

### Digital Audio

Goal
* To create audio signals with high fidelity and strong reproduction
Conversion
* ADC: Analog to digital converter
* DAC: Digital to analog converter

#### Digital audio conversion

1. Outer ear
	* auricle
	* external auditory canal
	* tympanic membrane
2. Middle ear
	* malleus
	* incus
	* stapes
	* oval window
	* round window
3. Inner ear
	* cochlea

### Sound pressure level (SPL)
* sound pressure is local pressure caused by a sound wave
* sound pressure level measures the magnitude of sound

## Digital Audio File Formats

* Digital Audio File structure
	* ![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTgiWcTM8Qn6Vy4TSztLAW9HiITXvnhw-9Asg8UV-mvmBmnJIrNCgoguwUPhULveOAQe-w&usqp=CAU)

* Differences in digital audio formats:
	* How signal is compressed
	* What error corection code (ECC) is used , if any
	* How data are organised

### Types of audio file formats


1. Uncompressed
	* WAV
	* AIFF
2. Lossless compression
	* FLAC
	* ALAC (.m4a)
	* MPEG-4 SLS
	* MPEG-4 ALS
	* MPEG-4 DST
	* Windows media audio lossless (WMA Lossless)
3. Lossy compression
	* MP3
	* AAC
	* ATRAC
	* Windows media audio lossy (WMA Lossy)

## Audio and Music players
* Portable vs non-portable
	* Loud speakers
	* ipods
* hardware vs Software
	* ipods
	* spotify etc

### Speakers
A speaker is an electroacoustic transducer that converts an electrical audio signal into a sound

### Multiple drivers in speakers
Tweeter:
* for high frequency component
* small and light, hence respond rapidly to applied signal

Woofer：
* for low frequency component
*  require more power since the signal must drive a large mass

### What makes a good loudspeaker
* The best speakers recreate sound accurately
* Frequency response charts the range of frequencies a speaker is capable of producing
* Key parameters:
	* Range of frequency response
	* Flatness of frequency response

## Audio Compression

### MP3
* MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio layer 3, commonly called MP3 an audio coding format for digital audio
* Designed by the Moving picture experts group (MPEG)
* Basic Idea
	* Use perceptual coding (psychoacoustic models) to approximate the accuracy of certain parts of sound that are beyoung auditory resolution for most people and then records the remaning information in an efficient manner
* Lossy data compression
	* Typical compression ratio from 4:1 to 20:1
