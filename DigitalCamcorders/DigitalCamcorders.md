**Digital video Camcorder**

* Digital video

* Digital camcorders

* structure and concepts

* Features and functionalities

* webcams, surveillance cameras and other emerging devices

  

## Digital video

Why digital video (DV) over Video Home system (VHS)?

* better video and audio quality

* easy to edit, transfer, distribute and store

* Easy and exact reproduction

* Provide error correction

* DV cameras are smaller

  

### What is a Video

  

* Video is a sequence of images presented at a speed that gives the perception of motion

* Each image is called a frame

* Rely on human's persistence of vision

* Some popular video formats:

* MPEG ( Moving pictures expert group)

* AVI (intel)

* WMV ( Microsoft)

*

#### Digital video organisation

Shot

* all videos are made up of shots

Frame

* each single picture in the video is called a frame

Composition

* layout content in a frame

#### Video basics

Frame rate: number of frames per second

Spatial resolution: number of pixels in each frame

Aspect ratio: ratio of image width to image height

Color resolution: bit depth of frames

Video data rate & file size

```
Example
24-bit color video, with 640 by 480 resolution at 30fps
uncompressed video rate = 640 x 480 x 24 x 30
						= 221, 184, 000
```

#### Video resolution
Standard definition (SD)
* NTSC(480i): 720 x 480, 640 x 480
* PAL(576i): 720x576

High Definition(HD)
* 720p: 1280 x 720 progressive
* 1080i: 1920 x 1080 interlaced
* 1080p: 1920 x 1080 progressive (full HD)

Ultra high definition (UHD)
* 4k ~ 4 times FHD
* 8k ~ 4 times 4k

#### Video Compression
Why is it necessary ?
* uncompressed video will require more than 100 Mbps ( exceeding capacity of most 4G and WiFi networks)

Why is it possible?
* exploting the following
	* Spatial redundancy
	* Temporal redundancy
	* Psychovisual redundancy

Intraframe compression
* consider each video frame as still image or picture
* Reduce spatial redundancy
* Employ techniques such as JPEG-based compression

Interframe compression
* utilize correlation along temporal domain
* reduce temporal redundancy
* employ motion estimation and compensation

#### YCbCr Color Space

* YCbCr color space represents colors in terms of:
	* a luminance component/luma(Y)
	* two chrominance components/chroma(Cb and Cr)

* Human eyes are sensitive to luminance, but less sensitive to chrominance
* To reduce video size or bitrate, subsampling is performed on the chrominance components. Hence, less bits are used to encode the chrominance than the luminance.

#### Chroma subsampling
* subsampling format:
	* 4:4:4
	no subsmapling
	* 4:2:2, 4:1:1
	horizontal subsampling
		*	4:1:1
			*	for every 4 horizontal Y samples, 1 Cr and 1 Cb chroma are sampled
		*	4:2:2
			*	For every 2 horizontal Y samples 1 Cr and 1 Cb chroma are sampled
	* 4:2:0
	horizontal and vertical subsampling
		* For every 2x2 Y samples, 1 Cr and 1 Cb chroma are sampled

#### Video format
* MPEG-2
* MPEG-4 AVC/H.264
* AVCHD ( a variant of H.264)
* Etc

#### Compression ratio
JPEG =  10:1 for general images
MPEG-2 = 30:1 for general videos
H.264/MPEG-4 AVC = 50:1 for general videos

### Closed circuit television (CCTV)
* uses video cameras to transmit signals to monitor
* Basic CCTV system consist of 3 components:
	* Camera
	* Monitor
	* Recording System
* CCTV is often used for surveillance in areas which need security, such as banks, casino, airports and military installations

### IP Camera
* Internet protocol camer (IP camera) is a type of digital video camera commonly used in surveillance
* Unlike analog CCTV cameras, IP cameras send and receive data via a computer network and the internet

#### **Picture Quality**

  

When it comes to picture quality, analog cameras are a no match to IP ones. Traditional cameras or Analog cameras are unable to produce a good resolution of the image it captures and that makes the purpose of installing a camera in any premises redundant. [IP cameras capture a far better quality](https://www.matrixvideosurveillance.com/blog/are-high-resolution-ip-cameras-the-secret-to-quality-surveillance/) than you could ever imagine achieving with a traditional CCTV.

  

Additionally, IP cameras possess a much wider field of view, meaning a single IP camera is potentially able to do the job of three to four Analog cameras.

  

#### **Video Analytics**

  

Well, do you wish to watch an event of just minutes or maybe, seconds but you end up watching hours and hours of video that the camera has captured. Rings a bell?

  

Gone are the days where you need to sit in front of a camera trying to inspect a single event. With intelligent video analytics, you can set your network to flag such events that occur within the camera’s field of vision. This event could be anything from motion detection to video tampering alarm, exception (network disconnected, IP address conflict, illegal login, HDD full, HDD error), line crossing detection or intrusion detection. So, instead of poring over hours of footage, IP cameras can tell you exactly when these events occurred.

  

#### **Flexibility and Scalability**

  

IP cameras generally consist of switches that allow other cameras in close proximity to each other to be connected to a single switch, which then can be connected with NVR with a single wire. This reduces the clutter of wire and allows you to connect more cameras because you’re no longer limited by the number of ports on your NVR. Whereas, in Analog cameras, you have to connect each camera directly into the DVR which creates a lot of clutter and is labor-intensive. IP cameras allow a PoE switch that enables the cable to run the signal and provide power to your camera, which negates the need for a separate power supply.

  

Matrix offers [5MP Dome IP Cameras](https://www.matrixvideosurveillance.com/project-series-dome-camera.html) to provide glitch-free performance even under extreme operating temperatures. These cameras are designed to provide high definition, crystal clear images and at the same time withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to the sturdiness, our IP Cameras can be used for both indoor (Dome Cameras preferred) as well as outdoor (Bullet Cameras preferred) applications. Furthermore, the dome variant of the Camera is vandal-proof, which comes with an unbreakable enclosure (IK10), making it impossible for miscreants to damage it.
